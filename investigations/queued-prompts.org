#+DATE: 2025-08-13

* Overview

A recursive continuation loop that processes user messages during long-running assistant tasks, ensuring seamless conversation flow and context preservation.

* Core Design

** Key Innovations
- Uses =yield*= for generator delegation
- Avoids traditional stack overflow
- Maintains conversation context
- Handles queued messages at natural continuation points

* Technical Architecture

** Generator Delegation Strategy
- Creates flat iteration chain
- Prevents traditional stack growth
- Allows logically deep "recursion" without performance penalty
- Supports complex, multi-stage interactions

* Conversation Continuation

** Message Processing
- Recursive turn processing
- Tool use creates natural continuation points
- Seamless message injection
- Efficient memory management

* Safety Mechanisms

- =maxTurns= limit (default 10)
- Counts only user messages
- Prevents infinite loops
- Maintains predictable conversation flow

* Performance Characteristics

- Low memory overhead
- Minimal computational complexity
- Adaptive context management
- Smooth user interaction

* Use Cases

- Long-running tool investigations
- Complex, multi-step problem solving
- Maintaining conversation state during extensive computations
- Handling interrupt-driven interactions

* Future Potential

- Machine learning-based turn optimization
- More sophisticated continuation strategies
- Advanced context preservation techniques
- Dynamic turn limit adjustment

* Conclusion

The queued prompts mechanism represents an innovative approach to managing conversational complexity, ensuring responsive and context-aware interactions.
