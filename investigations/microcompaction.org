#+DATE: 2025-08-13

* Overview

An intelligent context management system designed to optimize memory usage and maintain conversation relevance.

* Core Functionality

** Context Management Strategies
- Removes old tool result blocks when context nears capacity
- Preserves the last 3 tool uses
- Selectively removes results from read-heavy tools
- Uses 92% capacity as auto-compaction trigger

* Technical Implementation

** Optimization Techniques
- Intelligent result pruning
- Preservation of critical context
- Minimal information loss
- Dynamic capacity management

** Selection Criteria
- Recency of tool use
- Relevance to current task
- Size of result block
- Tool type and importance

* Performance Implications

- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster context switching
- Improved conversation continuity
- Efficient resource utilization

* Potential Future Enhancements

- Machine learning-based context preservation
- More granular compaction rules
- User-configurable compaction strategies
- Adaptive capacity management

* Conclusion

The microcompaction feature represents a sophisticated approach to managing conversational context, balancing information preservation with computational efficiency.
