Based on my investigation of the diff between v1.0.79 and v1.0.80, this is primarily an internal maintenance release with one notable change. Let me generate the changelog:

# Changelog for version 1.0.80

## 🎯 Highlights
This maintenance release focuses on internal code improvements and refactoring. The output style customization feature has been temporarily disabled while the team works on improvements.

## 🚀 New Features

*No new user-facing features in this release.*

## 💪 Improvements

### Code Quality and Performance
**What changed:** Internal refactoring of module imports and code organization
**Impact:** Improved code maintainability and potential minor performance improvements through better module loading patterns

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Disabled: Output Style Customization
- **Issue:** The output style feature (educational, hands-on modes) has been temporarily disabled
- **Cause:** The feature is undergoing improvements and has been disabled to prevent inconsistent behavior
- **Resolution:** The system now uses the default interaction style for all responses. Custom output styles configured in settings will not take effect until this feature is re-enabled in a future release

This is a maintenance release focused on internal improvements. Users should not experience any breaking changes to the CLI interface or core functionality. The output style feature will return in a future update with improvements based on user feedback.
