* Diff Types

** Structural Diffs
- Function-level changes
- Class method modifications
- Import/export alterations
- Type signature updates

** Semantic Diffs
- Logical flow changes
- Algorithmic optimizations
- Refactoring detection
- Performance impact analysis

* Representation Format

- JSON-based structure
- Line and character-level precision
- Metadata inclusion
- Language-agnostic design

* Change Categories

- Addition
- Deletion
- Modification
- Relocation
- Rename

* Advanced Features

- Whitespace-aware diffing
- Semantic change significance
- Cross-language diff comparison
- Automated change categorization

* Performance Considerations

- Efficient diff computation
- Minimal memory overhead
- Parallel processing support
- Incremental diff generation

* Future Potential

- Machine learning-enhanced diff analysis
- Predictive change recommendations
- Automated refactoring suggestions
- Cross-repository change tracking

* Conclusion

The diff specification provides a robust, flexible mechanism for representing and understanding code changes across diverse computational environments.
